# Covid_19-Data-Analysis-Project
### 📊 MySQL | Python | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **COVID-19 data analytics pipeline** built using  
**MySQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), and Power BI**.  
It analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using multiple real-world datasets,  
deriving insights on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, trends, and continent-level patterns.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Build a complete **ETL pipeline** using SQL, Python, and Power BI.  
- Clean, transform, and integrate **5 raw COVID-19 datasets** in MySQL.  
- Perform exploratory analysis and KPI generation using Python.  
- Develop an interactive and insight-driven dashboard in Power BI.  
- Highlight regional impact, trends, and performance insights globally.

## 🗄️ 1. MySQL — Data Cleaning & Modeling
### ✔️ Tasks Performed
- Created a database `covid19` and imported 5 datasets.
- Handled missing values, inconsistent formats, and datatype corrections.
- Designed an **EER model** establishing relationships between tables.
- Generated cleaned, structured tables for analysis.

### 📁 SQL Operations Included
- Data type conversions  
- Renaming inconsistent column names  
- Removing duplicates  
- Creating primary & foreign keys  
- Joining factual and dimensional tables 

## 🐍 2. Python — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ✔️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `sqlalchemy`

### ✔️ Key Analysis Performed
- Country-level and continent-level case comparison  
- KPI generation:  
  - Death Rate (%)  
  - Recovery Rate (%)  
  - Cases per Million  
  - Deaths per Million  
- Global daily trend analysis  
- Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn  

### 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Total Cases by Continent  
- Death/Recovery Rate Analysis  
- Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases  
- Daily Global Trend Line  
- Scatter Plot (Cases vs. Deaths)

## 📊 3. Power BI — Interactive Dashboard

The final dashboard was built to give Stakeholders a **business-friendly** overview.

### ✔️ Dashboard Features
- KPI Cards: Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recoveries, Death Rate%, Recovery Rate%  
- Continent-wise Comparison (Bar / Column Charts)  
- Country-wise Cases and Performance Breakdown  
- Daily Trend Line Visualization  
- Slicers for Continent, Country, and Date  
- Clean, professional layout with business insights.
